# Alisha-Chatbot

Alisha a chatbot developed by me can make you laugh by cracking jokes, suggesting some songs, detecting any cuss words entered by the user and might even reply when the user compliments the bot! It can also politely say thank you as well as greet you!
It was created by using IBM Watson assistant with IBM cloud platform.

Following is the link of the chatbot ALISHA.
